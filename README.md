# How to use these files


Paper available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03326

In order to run the python scripts, it's necessary to have MPCTools available here: https://bitbucket.org/rawlings-group/mpc-tools-casadi/src/master/

Another special package used in this work is the multiprocessing package for making use of multiple CPU cores for faster calculations.

This repository has two python scripts.
